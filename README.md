# About
I've always wanted to build a WordPress theme from scratch, just because it sounds like fun. So here it is.

## Goal
This project isn't about delivering a beautiful theme. It's about understanding what files go into a theme and what each one does. And it's about knowing how to get the right content when and where I want it.

### Responsive layout
I want my theme to be responsive, but I don't want to rely on a framework like Bootstrap to make that happen. I've written all the CSS myself.
